# QuickPoolsPublic


Hello everyone! 

This is the repo for the [QuickPools Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hss.quickpools&hl=en). Since I have a day job, and since so many really fantastic people have mentioned they'd love to help out, I'm opening this up for any (very needed) help with the project!

Warning! I wrote this application as a way to learn software on my own. As a result, it has a lot of... not so great practices that I know about now and don't have the time to update and/or change. Be prepared!

This project assumes that you have basic knowledge of Android Studio and Java programming. 

Here is the current wish list of things to happen for the application that are not currently implemented. 

**QuickPools Wish List**

* Pools
  * Save completed pools results and retrieve later for studying
  * Save progress of pool mid tournament (and come back to it later)
* Left handed folks
  * It doesn't seem to be handling left handed folks like it should. Needs more debugging
* UI Changes
  * Make it easier to use on newer, bigger phones
  
  
  
The list, of course, if not complete. If you have any comments or things you would like to add-on, please email Kat at codekatdroid@gmail.com.
